/*
ðŸ“˜ Redux - Definition:
Redux is a state management library for JavaScript apps, often used with React.
It allows you to manage application-wide state in a predictable way.

Core Concepts:
- Store: Single source of truth
- Actions: Describes what happened
- Reducers: Functions that update state
- Dispatch: Sends actions to the store
- useSelector/useDispatch: React-Redux hooks

Example Flow:
Dispatch(Action) â†’ Reducer updates state â†’ UI re-renders

Redux is useful for large applications with complex state needs.
