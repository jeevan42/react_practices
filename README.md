## 📁 Folder Structure

- **html-files/** –  
  Visual demos for:
  - **Event Bubbling vs Capturing**
  - `stopPropagation()` & `stopImmediatePropagation()`
  - Real DOM behavior with intuitive examples

- **theory/** –  
  In-depth `.js/.jsx` files explaining:
  - React internals (VDOM, Fiber, Reconciliation)
  - JSX, Props, State, Hooks, Router
  - Controlled vs Uncontrolled, useMemo, useCallback
  - Throttle vs Debounce, Zustand, Redux and more
